Build a ship by connecting Weapons/Thrusters to Frames. Frames have a letter. This letter (key) must be pressed to power the connected Weapon/Thruster.

Uniquely pilot your ship in the way only you can... because no one else will understand your weird setup.

Salvage parts from enemy ships or collect coins to buy from the shop. 

If you have too many letters and no fingers, grab a friend or grow some more fingers. Have fun!
